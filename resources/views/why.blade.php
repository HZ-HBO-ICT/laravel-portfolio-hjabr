                            <p>
                                Because in high school I was always interested in computer
                                science where I already learned about the basics of HTML.
                                I love to delve into ICT where hours pass without getting
                                bored. In addition, I am doing a project with a few
                                friends in which you have to work on a racing kart in a
                                group.
                            </p>
                            <span class="heading-meta"
                            >What would I do after my training?</span
                            >
                            <p>
                                Before I did this training, I already planned to work
                                somewhere in the ICT sector. I am personally not yet sure
                                which direction I want to go in the ICT sector because I
                                have not yet become acquainted with many parts.
