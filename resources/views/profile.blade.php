                                My name is Hesham Jabr and I am 28 years old. I live in a
                                small hamlet called Kamperland in Noord-beveland. I was
                                born in Syria. I really like to go to other countries and
                                discover their cultures. Usually when I go to another
                                country, I find it most comfortable to sleep in a tent
                                because then you get a more holiday feeling. I have been
                                to many countries and each country has its own special
                                things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My hobbies are tennis, football and DIY. I like the sport
                                very much to follow. I am also always interested in the IT
                                sector. This makes me even more focused on this year to
                                learn as much as possible.
